arithmetic operators

1) Write a Java program that takes two integer inputs and performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on them. Print the results of each operation clearly labeled.

2) Write a Java program that takes two integer inputs (dividend and divisor) and calculates and prints the remainder of their division using the modulo operator (%).

15)Write a Java program that takes three double variables (grade1, grade2, grade3) as input and calculates their average. Print the calculated average.

3) Write a Java program that evaluates the following expression and prints the result: 10 + 5 *3- 18 / 2. Explain the order in which the operations are performed.

16) Write a Java program that calculates the area of a rectangle. Declare two integer variables, length and width, initialize them, and then calculate and print the area.

17)Write a Java program to convert a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit. Declare a double variable celsius and initialize it.
 Use the formula Fahrenheit = (Celsius * 9/5) + 32 to calculate and print the Fahrenheit equivalent.


4) Write a Java program that takes the radius of a circle as input (as a double). Calculate and print the area (πr²) and the perimeter (2πr). Use π value as 3.14.

5) Write a Java program that takes five double inputs and calculates their average.

6) Write a Java program that takes the price of an item (double) and the quantity purchased (integer) as input. Calculate and print the total cost.

7) Write a Java program that takes the principal amount (double), the rate of interest (double), and the time period (double) as input. Calculate and print the simple interest using the formula: Simple Interest = (Principal * Rate * Time) / 100.

9) Write a Java program that takes two integer inputs and swaps their values without using a third temporary variable.

10) Write a Java program that takes a total number of seconds as input and converts it into hours, minutes, and seconds. For example, if the input is 3723 seconds, the output should be 1 hour, 2 minutes, and 3 seconds. 

12) Write a Java program that takes the number of kilometers traveled (double) and the amount of fuel consumed in liters (double) as input. Calculate and print the fuel efficiency in kilometers per liter.

13) Write a Java program that takes the total amount due (double) and the amount paid by the customer (double) as input. Calculate and print the change to be returned.

11) Write a Java program that takes the coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) of two points in a 2D plane as input (as doubles). Calculate and print the distance between the two points using the distance formula: √((x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)²). 
  Use Math.sqrt() and Math.pow().
