>>>>>>>Basic While Loop Questions<<<<<<<<

1)Print numbers from 1 to 10 using a while loop.

2)Print all even numbers between 1 and 50 using a while loop.

3)Print the sum of the first n natural numbers.
(Read n from the user)

6)Write a Java program to print odd numbers from a given range.

7)Write a Java program that calculates and prints the sum of odd and even numbers in a given range

4)Print the multiplication table of a number entered by the user (e.g., table of 5).

5)Print the digits of a number in reverse order.
(e.g., input = 123, output = 3 2 1)

>>>>>>Intermediate While Loop Questions<<<<<<<<

1)Count the number of digits in a given number.

2)Check if a number is a palindrome.
     (e.g., 121, 1221 → Palindrome; 123 → Not a palindrome)

3)Check if a number is an Armstrong number.
     (e.g., 153 = 1³ + 5³ + 3³)

4)Find the factorial of a number using a while loop.

5)Find the sum of digits of a number.

>>>>>>>Challenging While Loop Questions<<<<<<<<

1)Print Fibonacci series up to n terms using a while loop.

2)Find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers using a while loop.

3)Print all prime numbers between 1 and n using a while loop.

4)Read numbers continuously until the user enters 0. Then print the sum of all entered numbers.

5)Simulate a simple number guessing game using a while loop.
    (Keep asking the user to guess until they get the correct number)

--------------------------------------------------------- do-while loop--------------------------------------------------------------

1)Write a program that uses a do-while loop to print numbers from 1 to 100.

2)Write a program to keep asking the user to enter numbers. Add them all until the user enters 0, then print the total sum.

3)Write a program to keep asking the user to enter positive numbers. If a negative number is entered, show an error and ask again. Stop the loop when the user enters 0.

4)Write a program that keeps asking the user to enter the correct password using a do-while loop. Exit the loop only when the correct password (e.g., "admin123") is entered.

5)Write a program to reverse the digits of a number using a do-while loop. Example: input = 1234 → output = 4321.

6)Write a menu-driven program using a do-while loop with the following options:

	Add

	Subtract

	Exit

Perform the operation based on user input and keep showing the menu until the user selects Exit.

7)Write a program to keep accepting numbers from the user and count how many are even and how many are odd. Stop when the user enters 0, then display the counts.

8)Write a program that asks the user to enter a number and uses a do-while loop to calculate the factorial of that number.

9)Write a number guessing game using a do-while loop. The program should keep asking the user to guess a number until they guess the correct one.

10)Write a program to generate the multiplication table of a given number using a do-while loop (up to 10).

----------------------------------------------------------------for loop-----------------------------------------------------------------------

1)Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 100 using a for loop.

3)Write a program to print the multiplication table of a given number using a for loop.

4)Write a program to find the factorial of a number using a for loop.

5)Write a program to find the sum of all numbers from 1 to N using a for loop.

6)Write a program to count and print how many numbers between 1 to 100 are divisible by 5 using a for loop.

7)Write a program to print all the digits of a given number using a for loop.

8)Write a program to reverse a number using a for loop.

9)Write a program to check if a number is a prime number using a for loop.

10)Write a program to print the Fibonacci series up to N terms using a for loop.
